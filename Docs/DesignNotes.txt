NOTES on Pseudo-3D Isometric Engine:

* Use dynamic two-dimensional arrays to contain map-tile data.  Maybe a dynamic linked-list of such maps can constitute multiple levels?
* Make each tile a class that is as self-sufficient as possible and will lend itself well to script manipulation
* Object placed on tiles should also be class-based.  Maybe one class for moving sprites and another class for the static scene decorations.  Try and anticipate expanding scene decors to be animated.
* All stuff should have height values to support other levels -- multiple floors on buildings for instance.


Sprite Graphics:
* static images, one facing each direction.  total of 8.
* idle animation.  4 frames each direction.  32.
* walking animation, maybe 6 frames.  one set for each direction.  48.
* running animation. same as walking animation.  48.

Graphics to create:
* Terrain tiles
	Grass, Soil, Snow, Moss(decor?), Swamp, Rocks(decor?), 
	Desert Sand, Beach Sand, Bushes (decor?),
	Shallow water, Medium water, Deep Water
* Terrain decors
	Rocks (3+ types), Bushes (4+ types), Trees (4+ kinds),
	Scattered leaves, trash, crates, barrels
